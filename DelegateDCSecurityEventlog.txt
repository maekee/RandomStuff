#How to delegate read permissions to the Security Eventlog on domain controllers
1. Open cmd as Admin and run the command:Â wevtutil gl security
2. Take the channelAccess string and append (A;;0x1;;;YourADGroupSIDHere), then execute the command:
   wevtutil sl security /ca:<channelAccess>(A;;0x1;;;SID)
   example: wevtutil sl security /ca:O:BAG:SYD:(A;;CCLCSDRCWDWO;;;SY)(A;;CCLC;;;BA)(A;;CC;;;ER)(A;;CC;;;NS)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-20)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-21-111111111-1111111111-111111111-11111)
3. Open regedit and go to HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/EventLog/Security
4. Right click the Security key - Permissions...
5. Add the AD group with read permissions you appended in step 2

Now you can check if it works from another machine with PowerShell command, enter account that is a member of the AD group you added.
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -ComputerName DOMAINCONTROLLERNAME -MaxEvents 10 -Credential (Get-Credential) -ErrorAction Stop

If it doesnt work, make sure that the account in the AD group is known of the membership and the HW FW/WinFW is open.
